Online Store:
Overview
Create an online store. Your React app will have a landing page with a few featured products, a search box, and a list of categories. When the user inputs search text, you'll present them with a list of products that match. Similarly, if a user selects a category, they'll get a list of products in that category. Selecting a product brings up the detailed information about that product including an "Add to cart" button.

This projet will be using the MERN stack and will be hosted on AWS so it is scalable
